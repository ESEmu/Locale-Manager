- OFFICIAL MODDING TOOL -

Name: Locale Manager (LManager)
Coder: d3vil401/d3v1l401 (http://d3vsite.org)

What is this tool supposed to do?

Decrypts and encrypts the .ess translations file, so you can translate the client and share your work to all the ESEmu community.




How to use:

- Double click Locale Manager.bat
- Type "LManager.exe <name of the translations file as input>.ess <output decrypted translations file>.txt"
- Press Enter

Example:
LManager.exe general.ess decrypted.txt

There will be a file with the name parsed as second argument (decrypted.txt in this example), just open it and modify all the strings
you want to.
WARNING:

DO NOT TOUCH THE ARROW CHARACTERS (→).
DO NOT TOUCH THE DYNAMIC VARIABLE REPLACERS (@1, @2, @3 ...).
DO NOT TOUCH THE NUMBERS AND THE "BIG" SPACE (TAB) BETWEEN THE NUMBER AND THE TEXT, IT IS THE UNIQUE STRING IDENTIFYER.
IT'S USELESS TO TRANSLATE THE KOREAN UNTRANSLATED STRINGS, SINCE THEY ARE NOT USED BY THE GAME OR JUST USED BY THE GAME MODERATORS.

Once you finish to translate and just want to test it, you have to do the same thing, but parsing the first parameters as the decrypted file.
(DELETE THE OLD general.ess FIRST!)

Example:
LManager.exe decrypted.txt general.ess

Now you have finished the work.


HELP I DON'T WHERE I CAN FIND A GENERAL.ESS TO EDIT!

Just open your ElSword installation folder and go to data, there you can find the general.ess.
Example:
C:\Program Files (x86)\ElSword\data\
